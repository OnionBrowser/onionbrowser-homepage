<p class="mid">Due to iOS limitations, <b>WebRTC and media files leak outside of Tor</b> and are routed over the normal internet. This will reveal your real IP address (or your VPN's address) to sites using these features. To defend against this, disable Javascript by setting the security level to "Strict". <a href="https://github.com/OnionBrowser/OnionBrowser/wiki/Traffic-that-leaks-outside-of-Tor-due-to-iOS-limitations">More information about these types of leaks can be found here.</a></p>
